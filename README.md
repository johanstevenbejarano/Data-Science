# Data Science Capstone Project

This repository contains all notebooks, scripts, and datasets developed during the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Capstone Project**.

## 📁 Contents

- 📌 **Data Collection**: Using APIs and Web Scraping to gather launch data from SpaceX.
- 🧹 **Data Wrangling**: Cleaning and organizing datasets for analysis.
- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
  - SQL queries using SQLite to explore launch outcomes and payload data.
  - Visualizations with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium for geographic insights.
- 📈 **Interactive Visualizations**:
  - Built with Plotly Dash to allow dynamic exploration of launch success.
- 🤖 **Predictive Modeling**:
  - Supervised learning models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, KNN).
  - Hyperparameter tuning and accuracy comparisons.

## 🧪 Final Result

An end-to-end project that applies the full data science lifecycle — from data acquisition to model deployment — using SpaceX Falcon 9 launch data.

> This project demonstrates practical knowledge in data collection, analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling for real-world applications in aerospace.
